About Me Website. Went for a minimalist design. Links to resume, Linkedin, Github, and email.

## Frameworks Used
* Bootstrap (Minimum grid usage)
* Font Awesome (For icons)

## Future enhancements
* Clean up frameworks used. Not using all of the framework so can get rid of some of it to save space.
* Need to handle mobile spacing a bit better
* Make shape animations have more unique shapes
